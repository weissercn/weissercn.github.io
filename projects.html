          <p><a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/alumni">As part of MATS 6.0 supervised by CHAI's Micah Carroll, me and
              my collaborators demonstrated that targeted manipulation and deception emerge in LLMs trained on user
              rather than annotator feedback. Our MATS stream's paper was accepted as an oral contribution at the SATA
              workshop and a spotlight at the SoLaR workshop, both at NeurIPS.

              My experience at MATS led to my role as the first technical staff member at Haize Labs. There, I focuses
              on LLM automated red teaming and jailbreak protection supporting labs such as Anthropic, OpenAI, and
              AI21.</a></p>

          <h3>Frontier Development Lab 2022 (Forecasting Earthquakes around CO2 sequestration sites with DoE)</h3>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2022 McKinsey and company sponsored the Frontier Development Lab by staffing a Data
            Scientist, Constantin,
            to be the machine learning and process lead for the CO2 project. Here is an overview of its motivations and
            goals:
          </p>
          <p>
            Climate change from greenhouse gas emissions pose serious sustainability challenges for humanity.
            Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 mandates capturing and storing over 30 billion metric tons of CO2, in
            addition to
            reducing emissions. The most promising storage solution is geologic carbon sequestration: injecting CO2
            into the earth’s surface. However, previous studies have shown that excessive CO2 injections can cause
            earthquakes.
            Forecasting these earthquakes from pressure and past seismological data can allow sequestration operators to
            decide when to slow down or pause operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current state-of-the-art physical methods are either inaccurate or have suboptimal software implementations
            that
            are prohibitively slow and require seismology-PhD-level expertise to train (e.g. CRS model). For each new
            sequestration
            site, seismologists have to wait for sufficient data before making useful predictions. Hence, the community
            is
            eager for outside approaches. The aim of this engagement is to tackle these shortcomings while retaining
            trust of all
            stakeholders. Supported by more induced seismological data than any other team has had access to and
            endorsed by
            seismology and ML experts, this project’s long term improvement targets and stages are:
          <ol>
            <li>1. Accessibility and Training Speed: Produce a streamlined implementation of the CRS model</li>
            <li>2. Accuracy: Adapt state-of-the-art ML time series methods like SCInet to be used alongside CRS
              predictions</li>
            <li>3. Trust and Transfer Learning: Build a hypernetwork that can predict the optimal parameters on the CRS
              model
              using less data than required to perform a CRS model fit</li>
          </ol>
          </p>

          <h3>Frontier Development Lab 2021 (Coastal Digital Twin with NASA)</h3>
          <p>Joined the collaboration between NASA Ames, the SETI Institute, and commercial AI partners like Google
            Cloud to minimize the deleterious effects of climate change. Our four-person team's approach to this problem
            is to speed up flood predictions by building a machine learning surrogate model for an established
            inundation height model like NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean). We were the first to apply
            the physics-informed state-of-the-art Fourier Neural Operator models to a real-world setting and predicted
            inundation height better than the physical and ML baselines. Furthermore, we provide a package called
            "coastal twin" that documents and automates our work and is a platform for further collaboration for earth
            and ML scientists. Our work is a step in the direction of making practical, high-precision flooding
            predictions a possibility, which would inform evacuation orders and save lives.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://youtu.be/pekuBUhw2CY?t=2952">CERN & The Sense of Beauty</a></h3>
          <p><a href="https://youtu.be/pekuBUhw2CY?t=2952">In 2014 I gave an impromptu interview about beauty in physics
              and was told that it might be used for a movie. In 2024 a friend randomly watched the movie and told me
              that it was used in a movie.</a></p>

          <h3>Moment Decomposition</h3>
          <p>At the NeurIPS 2020 "Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences" workshop, my colaborator presented our
            work on Moment Decomposition (MoDe). MoDe is a fast and easy general method to flexibly control ML
            classifier dependence on a continuous feature. While this approach is crucial to prevent biasing of particle
            physics analyses while retaining classification power, it could be applied to constrain the COVID vaccine
            distribution fractions to be at most quadratic in age. </p>

          <h3>Autoencoders for Compression and Simulation in Particle Physics</h3>
          <p>At the ICLR 2020 "Fundamental Science in the era of AI" workshop, I presented a poster about using
            generative models to simulate particle identification features. Without a fundamentally more CPU-efficient
            simulation generation procedure like the one proposed, particle physics experiments like LHCb will not be
            able to benefit sufficiently from the 100-fold increase in data rate. Research conducted after this
            presentation showed that normalizing flow based architectures, especially those based on <a
              href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05164">Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks</a>, yield even more
            high-fidelity simulation samples. </p>

          <h3>Dark Photons at LHCb</h3>
          <p>One of the largest open questions in particle physics is finding out about the nature of Dark Matter - an
            unknown substance that constitutes 85% of the matter of our universe and is needed to explain galaxy
            dynamics amongst other phenomena. The dark photon model has become increasingly popular as a steppinng stone
            towards a more complete understanding. We test this model with the LHCb experiment, set world-leading
            limits, and help shed light on this mystery of dark matter. </p>
